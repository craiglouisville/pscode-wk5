// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

Enter / input a number

If number % 2 == 0, number is even

Else number is odd

Display number and if Even or Odd



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

Input / Enter num 1, num 2, num 3, num 4, num 5

Calculation total of numbers - total = num 1 + num 2 + num 3 + num 4 + num 5

Calculation average of total number - total / 5 = average

Display lowest number - smallest = num 1
Displaly largest number - largest = num 2

Verbiage / message - Average - average number for the five entered numbers is ___

Veribage / mesage - Largest / Smallest - smallest number for the five entered number is ____; largest number for the five enetered numbers is ____.
